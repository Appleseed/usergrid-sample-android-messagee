Messagee is a sample android app that acts as a Usergrid client.


I make a truck from 
https://github.com/apigee/usergrid-sample-android-messagee
to
https://github.com/ablozhou/usergrid-sample-android-messagee

1. Change to newest usergrid sdk.

2. Add messagee to ADT eclipse project.

3. Change to newest library of fastxml.

I also create an ADT eclipse project of newest UserGrid Android SDK.
